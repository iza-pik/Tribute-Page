          <strong>Augusta Ada King, Countess of Lovelace</strong> (née Byron; 10
          December 1815 – 27 November 1852) was an English mathematician and
          writer, chiefly known for her work on Charles Babbage's proposed
          mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine. She was
          the first to recognise that the machine had applications beyond pure
          calculation, and published the first algorithm intended to be carried
          out by such a machine. As a result, she is sometimes regarded as the
          first to recognise the full potential of a "computing machine" and the
          first computer programmer.
